# sort-table-rows-alphabetically
Sort table rows alphabetically based on values in a column.

This code includes a function that can sort table rows alphabetically based on values in a column. The function has the following characteristics and functionality:

* it takes two arguments:

col -> This argument is a number and represents the index of the column that is used to sort the table. Remember that indices start at zero.
table -> This argument is the table element you want to sort.
* your code should assume that every value that is compared is a string
* your function can and should assume that the table has only one tbody element
* only the rows inside the tbody element are sorted and table head remains untouched
* whole rows change their order and not only the cells on the selected column
* every sorting of the table uses the current order of the table rows as its starting point and not the original order of the rows
